### Basic Settings

### Overlay Settings

- **Position**: Decides where Speaki will stay.
  - **Random (Default)**: Speaki is on the thumbnail without any thought.

- **Image Count (Random only)**: Adjusts the number of Speaki individuals.
- **Size**: Sets the minimum ~ maximum size of Speaki.
- **Rotation**: Adjusts the angle Speaki tilts directly.

- **Thumbnail Color Sync**: Corrects Speaki's tone to match the thumbnail's tone.
  - **Lighting Intensity**: Adjusts Speaki's lighting to match how dark or bright the thumbnail is.
