Speaki appears on YouTube thumbnails.

### Basic Settings

- **Language**: English, Korean, Japanese.
- **Appearance Chance**: Decide whether Speaki appears on all thumbnails or just occasionally as a surprise. (0% ~ 100%)
- **Flip Chance**: Choose the direction Speaki looks. (At 100%, Speaki looks to the left.)

### Overlay Settings

- **Position**:
  - **Smart (Default)**: Analyzes the thumbnail to find a spot that covers the content as little as possible.
  - **Random**: Speaki appears randomly on the thumbnail without thinking.
  - **Fixed Position**: Places Speaki safely in a desired corner (e.g., top-left, bottom-right) or center.
- **Size**: Set the minimum and maximum size of the appearing Speaki.
- **Tilt**: Adjust the angle Speaki tilts.
- **Opacity**: Make Speaki transparent to keep the thumbnail visible.
- **Thumbnail Color Sync**:
  - Adjusts Speaki's tone to match the thumbnail's tone.
